## PyTorch Model for Risk Assessment

The health agent utilizes a PyTorch-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for real-time risk assessment. This model is designed to analyze sequential health data and predict potential health risks based on historical and current metrics.

### Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: The model takes a sequence of health metrics (e.g., heart rate, blood glucose, SpO2) as input.
- **LSTM Layer**: A bidirectional LSTM layer processes the input sequence, capturing temporal dependencies and patterns in the data.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: The output from the LSTM is passed through fully connected layers to produce a risk score.
- **Output Layer**: The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function to output a risk score between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate greater health risks.

### Functionality

- **Risk Assessment**: The model assesses the risk of health anomalies by analyzing trends and patterns in the input data.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: It continuously processes incoming health data to provide real-time risk assessments and alerts.
- **Integration with Health Agent**: The model is integrated into the health agent to enhance its ability to detect and respond to potential health issues promptly.

This model is a critical component of the health monitoring system, enabling proactive health management and timely interventions.
