   cd personal-health-monitoring-system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install MongoDB:

   **Ubuntu/Debian:**
   ```bash
   # Import MongoDB public GPG key
   curl -fsSL https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-6.0.asc | \
      sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg \
      --dearmor

   # Create list file for MongoDB
   echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list

   # Update package list
   sudo apt-get update

   # Install MongoDB
   sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

   # Start MongoDB
   sudo systemctl start mongod

   # Enable MongoDB to start on boot
   sudo systemctl enable mongod
   ```

   **macOS (using Homebrew):**
   ```bash
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community
   brew services start mongodb-community
   ```

   **Windows:**
   - Download MongoDB Community Server from [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
   - Run the installer
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - MongoDB will be installed as a Windows service and started automatically

5. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Home.py
   ```

### Data Generation and Import

1. Generate synthetic health data:
   ```bash
   python tests/generate_data.py
   ```

2. Import data into MongoDB:
   ```bash
   python tests/import_to_mongo_db.py
   ```

   Optional arguments:
   ```bash
   python tests/import_to_mongo_db.py --file path/to/data.json --uri mongodb://your-connection-string
   ```

## PyTorch Model for Risk Assessment

The health agent utilizes a PyTorch-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for real-time risk assessment. This model is designed to analyze sequential health data and predict potential health risks based on historical and current metrics.

### Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: The model takes a sequence of health metrics (e.g., heart rate, blood glucose, SpO2) as input.
- **LSTM Layer**: A bidirectional LSTM layer processes the input sequence, capturing temporal dependencies and patterns in the data.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: The output from the LSTM is passed through fully connected layers to produce a risk score.
- **Output Layer**: The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function to output a risk score between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate greater health risks.

### Functionality

- **Risk Assessment**: The model assesses the risk of health anomalies by analyzing trends and patterns in the input data.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: It continuously processes incoming health data to provide real-time risk assessments and alerts.
- **Integration with Health Agent**: The model is integrated into the health agent to enhance its ability to detect and respond to potential health issues promptly.

This model is a critical component of the health monitoring system, enabling proactive health management and timely interventions.

## MongoDB Import Test

For details on how to connect to a remote MongoDB instance and import data, please refer to the [MongoDB Import Test](tests/README.md) documentation. A screenshot of the successful import is available at [mongo-db-screen-shot.png](mongo-db-screen-shot.png).
