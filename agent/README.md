# Health Agent Implementation

## PyTorch Model for Risk Assessment

The health agent utilizes a PyTorch-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for real-time risk assessment. This model is designed to analyze sequential health data and predict potential health risks based on historical and current metrics.

### Model Architecture

The `RiskAssessmentModel` class implements a neural network with the following components:

- **Input Layer**: Takes a sequence of 7 health metrics:
  - Heart rate
  - Systolic blood pressure
  - Diastolic blood pressure
  - Blood glucose
  - SpO2 (blood oxygen)
  - Sleep duration
  - Activity level

- **LSTM Layer**: A bidirectional LSTM layer that processes the input sequence, capturing temporal dependencies and patterns in the data. The hidden size is set to 64 by default.

- **Fully Connected Layers**: The output from the LSTM is passed through:
  - A linear layer reducing dimensions to 32
  - ReLU activation
  - Final linear layer
  - Sigmoid activation to output a risk score between 0 and 1

### Implementation Details

The model is implemented in `health_agent.py` and is used in a hybrid approach:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The `HealthDataset` class prepares the data for the model
   - Sequences of 10 time steps are created from historical data
   - Features are standardized using `StandardScaler`

2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The model is used in conjunction with rule-based assessment
   - Final risk score is a weighted combination:
     - 70% from rule-based assessment
     - 30% from LSTM model predictions

3. **Model Integration**:
   - The model is initialized in the `HealthAgent` class
   - Registered with MLflow for tracking and versioning
   - Used in real-time monitoring and historical analysis

### Usage in the System

The model is actively used in several components:

1. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Processes incoming health data
   - Generates risk scores and alerts
   - Updates patient-specific thresholds

2. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Provides risk analysis over time
   - Visualizes risk scores and trends
   - Helps identify patterns in health data

3. **Data Generation**:
   - Validates generated synthetic data
   - Ensures realistic health patterns
   - Tests the model's response to various scenarios

### Model Training and Updates

The model is designed to be updated and improved over time:

1. **MLflow Integration**:
   - Tracks model versions
   - Logs performance metrics
   - Enables model comparison and selection

2. **Continuous Learning**:
   - Adapts to patient-specific patterns
   - Updates based on new data
   - Maintains performance through regular evaluation

### Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the health agent
agent = HealthAgent()

# Process new health data
health_data = HealthData(
    patient_id="P001",
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    heart_rate=85,
    blood_glucose=120,
    spo2=97
)

# Create agent state
state = AgentState(
    current_data=health_data,
    historical_data=[],
    alerts=[],
    risk_score=0.0
)

# Get risk assessment
result = agent.invoke(state)
print(f"Risk Score: {result.risk_score}")
print(f"Latest Alert: {result.alerts[-1]}")
```

This implementation provides a robust foundation for health risk assessment, combining the power of deep learning with traditional rule-based approaches for comprehensive patient monitoring.
